#logging.properties file.
# "handlers" specifies a comma separated list of log Handler 
# classes. These handlers will be installed during VM startup.
# Note that these classes must be on the system classpath.
# By default we only configure a ConsoleHandler, which will only
# show messages at the INFO and above levels.

	handlers= java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# Default global and local package logging level.

    .level= INFO
    dsi.level=INFO

# Limit the messages that are printed on the console to INFO and above.

    java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = ALL
    java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter = 
                                    java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter

# The logger with javax.jms.connection name space will write
# Level.INFO messages to its output handler(s). In this configuration 
# the ouput handler is set to java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.

    javax.jms.connection.level = INFO

#Clients should normally use the predefined Level constants such as Level.SEVERE.
#The levels in descending order are:

#SEVERE (highest value) #WARNING #INFO #CONFIG #FINE #FINER #FINEST (lowest value)
#In addition there is a level OFF that can be used to turn off logging, and a level ALL that can be used to enable logging of all messages
