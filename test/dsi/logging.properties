#logging.properties file.
# "handlers" specifies a comma separated list of log Handler 
# classes. These handlers will be installed during VM startup.
# Note that these classes must be on the system classpath.
# By default we only configure a ConsoleHandler, which will only
# show messages at the INFO and above levels.

	handlers= java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# Default global logging level.
# This specifies which kinds of events are logged across
# all loggers. For any given facility this global level
# can be overriden by a facility-specific level.
# Note that the ConsoleHandler also has a separate level
# setting to limit messages printed to the console.

    .level= INFO
    dsi.level=INFO

# Limit the messages that are printed on the console to INFO and above.

    java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = ALL

                                    java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter

# The logger with javax.jms.connection name space will write
# Level.INFO messages to its output handler(s). In this configuration 
# the ouput handler is set to java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.

    javax.jms.connection.level = INFO

#Clients should normally use the predefined Level constants such as Level.SEVERE.
#The levels in descending order are:

#SEVERE (highest value)
#WARNING
#INFO
#CONFIG
#FINE
#FINER
#FINEST (lowest value)
#In addition there is a level OFF that can be used to turn off logging,
#and a level ALL that can be used to enable logging of all messages
